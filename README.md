* This is a pre-release version of this system for testing and feedback only!  It is not intended for use in setting up a real campaign, as significant aspects of the system are either a) not yet implemented, or b) likely toi change in ways that might break any game you've set up with this version. *

## Implemented So Far

- "Pusher and Shover" character sheets
- Attack, save, and hero die rolls from the character sheet with selectable boon/bane options
- Item types & sheets for all the kinds of items needed

## To Do
- Spell & Miracle rolls
- EZD6 style initiative (currently defaults to D&D style)
- Monster character sheets
- Method to add attack, save, hero-die macros to FVTT macro bar
- Probably more stuff I've forgotten or not yet discovered
