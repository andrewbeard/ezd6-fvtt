# EZD6 system for FoundryVTT
Foundry VTT system for playing Scotty McFarland's EZD6.

---

*This is a pre-release version of this system for testing and feedback only!  It is not intended for use in setting up a real campaign, as significant aspects of the system are either a) not yet implemented, or b) likely to change in ways that might break any game you've set up with this version.*

## The Game
[EZD6](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/397599/EZD6-Core-Rulebook?affiliate_id=1692486) by Scotty McFarland (a.k.a. "DM Scotty") is "A rules-light D6 RPG system that puts creativity over complexity, but delivers a suprising amount of variation and mechanical wiggle".

This code is an open source project unaffiliated with the game.

## Using this System
In keeping with the simplicty of the EZD6 system, automation is minimal - it's really not needed here and could get in the way!

All character and monster features except for the basic stats are types of Items in Foundry, meaning the Rabble Rouser (GM) can build their own collections and compendiums of features to easily drag and drop onto new creations.


## To Do
- EZD6 style initiative (currently defaults to D&D style)
- Method to add attack, save, hero-die macros to FVTT macro bar
- Probably more stuff I've forgotten or not yet discovered

## Support
This is a hobby project so I can't guarantee a fast response to questions, but I'll be at least semi-regularly visting [Scotty's Discord](https://discord.gg/Abp22Ja6aK) to reply to questions and feedback.  (I'm @drl2 there.)

## Contributing
EZD6 is simple enough that I'm not looking for assistance in developing the functional system at this time.  However, assistance in the following areas is welcome:
- Non-English translation
- A better default character icon!

## The Other Kind of Contributing
This project is free and open source, but if you're feeling generous and would like to Toss A Coin to your Coder (try explaining that one when somebody reads this in five years!), there a a couple of ways to do so:

- Donate via [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/drl2461951)
- Buy stuff through my [DriveThruRPG affiliate link](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/?affiliate_id=1692486)
- Use this [Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3kGDqgc) when you're planning to make a purchase from the giant evil megacorp.
